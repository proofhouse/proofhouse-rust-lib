# Default recipe
default: test

# --- Build ---

# Build the library in release mode
build:
    cargo build --release

# Remove the target/ build tree
clean:
    cargo clean

# Check that release builds are reproducible. Copy the working tree
# (minus .git and target, so the untracked Cargo.lock still rides
# along) into a temp dir, build it, record the rlib's sha256, run
# `cargo clean`, build a second time, and compare — failing on any
# mismatch.
#
# This is a same-dir double build, not the build-from-two-paths check
# the binary sibling can use. An rlib carries its crate metadata, and
# that metadata records source paths which --remap-path-scope=object
# leaves alone: the scope confines path rewriting to emitted objects,
# which is what keeps a final binary path-independent but also means
# two builds of this library from different directories embed different
# paths and never match, byte-identical source or not — the workspace
# path-hashing caveat, cargo#13586. Holding the directory fixed is the
# way to isolate genuine nondeterminism (timestamps, map iteration,
# codegen ordering) from that path noise until the caveat is resolved.
#
# The remap flags still run so object code stays path-independent for
# parity with the binary crate; --remap-path-scope=object is stable
# since 1.95, and cargo's trim-paths profile key would subsume these
# flags once it leaves nightly (cargo#12137). The library embeds no
# git-derived data, so excluding .git only trims the copy.
# SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH is exported for parity with the sibling repos;
# rustc ignores it on Linux and macOS today, so it only guards against
# future timestamp stamping.

# --- Test ---

# Run the test suite. Trailing arguments pass through to cargo test, so

# harness.

# --- Dependencies ---

# Check that Cargo.lock is in sync with the manifests. Under the locked
# flag `cargo metadata` reads the dependency graph without refreshing
# the lock, so a missing or stale Cargo.lock makes it fail rather than
# silently re-resolve. The `cargo update` variants are the wrong tool:
# they report any upgrade the registry offers, not whether the committed
# lock still matches Cargo.toml. CI runs this on every PR; contributors
# regenerate the lock and commit the result.

# --- Lint ---

# Aggregate lint gate. Every checker the repo gains hangs off this one
# recipe, so there is a single command to run them all. Prose and TOML
# are its members today.
lint: lint-prose lint-toml

# Lint prose in Markdown files and source comments via vale. The glob
# drops the LICENSE (canonical Apache 2.0 text), the generated
# changelog, vale's own synced style packages, scratch dirs, the
# gitignored agent worktrees under .claude/worktrees/, the
# COMMIT_AGENTMSG draft (.vale.ini judges a commit message under its
# own stricter scope), and the cargo build tree; the per-file-type
# rules in .vale.ini decide what else gets inspected. Findings render
# through the proofhouse-agent template from the proofhouse package:
# one machine-parseable line per finding.

    vale --output=proofhouse-agent.tmpl --glob='!{LICENSE,CHANGELOG.md,.vale/*,tmp/*,.claude/worktrees/*,COMMIT_AGENTMSG,target/*}' {{ if args == "" { "." } else { args } }}

# tombi is the org TOML gate (tombi 1.2.0): lint-checks Cargo.toml (validated offline
# against the embedded SchemaStore cargo.json), rust-toolchain.toml, .cargo/config.toml,
# and workspace member manifests. Format gate runs in --check --diff so unformatted TOML
# fails without rewrite. Cargo.lock is excluded from formatting via tombi.toml. --offline
# keeps CI hermetic; --error-on-warnings makes warnings hard failures. Scope lives in
# tombi.toml, so no path args are passed.
lint-toml:
    tombi format --check --diff
    tombi lint --offline --error-on-warnings

# --- Format ---

# Aggregate in-place formatter. Grows per gate; carries the TOML fixer today.
format: format-toml

# In-place TOML formatter — fixer paired with lint-toml's --check gate. Whitespace/style
# only; key order preserved (reordering disabled in tombi.toml).
format-toml:
    tombi format

# --- Utilities ---

# Sync Vale styles and dictionaries. Run once after cloning the repo,
# and whenever .vale.ini's Packages list changes. CI runs this before
# `just lint-prose`.
